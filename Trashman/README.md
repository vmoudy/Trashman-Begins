# Trashman-Begins
**By the MisoHungry team**

	PLEASE PLAY THIS ON CHROME. OTHERS ARE SLIGHTLY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS GAME. ( IF YOU HAVE A TOUCHSCREEN LAPTOP, PLEASE USE TOUCHSCREEN FOR ALL THE BUTTONS ).

###DESCRIPTION:

This game will be mostly adventure and education genres. Adventure from exploring and educational from talking to NPCâ€™s who give the player actual data collected that has been collected by climate scientist for years. Another theme that is probably a little subtle is the sense of urgency. By including the time mechanic the player will get a sense that he or she has to hurry to achieve the best score. A problem in combating climate change right now is that we are running out of time. If we do not make rapid, progressive change, then time will run out. Mankind is getting closer and closer to the point of no return and by adding the time element to the game, the player will feel that pressure as well. The target audience is for people who know little about climate change but would like to know more. There will be facts that hopefully the player will find interesting and look more into how they can alter their behaviour and help make change in the real world.

######WALKTHROUGH:	
1. You starts off at Tibbers Town. Talk to NPC (Alice) and she will tell you to head South to Antarctica Town.
2. You will travel through two maps before getting to Antarctica. Try to pick up trash and kill off enemies to get more points (trigger better ending). You will meet Miku at Antarctica Town and she will asks you to help her rescuing penguins. Talk to her after each level to get your reward (points) for every penguin you save.
4. You will then receive a TURBINE BLADE after you're done helping her and return to Tibbers Town. Talk to Alice and you will then asked to head West to Aohari Town.
5. After traveling through three maps, you will arrive at Aohari City. Talk to Reki and she will asks you to help her destroy the Corporation by meeting her North of Aohary City. You will then have to pass through 3 puzzles to get to the end stage where you destroy a machine by throwing trash at it. Talk to Reki afterward to get your rewards.
7. You will then return to Tibbers Town and receive your last mission of going East to Gobi Town and talk to Mimi there.
8. You will travel through three maps before getting to Gobi Town. Make sure to explore the map and talk to Ariel to get your Turbine Blades. When you arrived at Gobi Town, Mimi will welcome you and tell you to head North to fix the broken Turbine. 
9. After fixing the Turbine, you will be sent back to headquarter and that is where your ending will trigger based on your performance.

######ENDINGS:
1. Best ending: "You helped saving the world." This ending is quite hard to get, especially for first time players. You have to finish this game quickly within a 	short amount of times. 
2. Okay ending: "You did your job.. nothing really changed though." Not hard to get.
3. Bad ending: "You did not help anything and the world is in bad shape... probably going to be destroyed." You can trigger this ending by going AFK or something. Even if you pass all the puzzles, you still can trigger this ending if you took too long.
